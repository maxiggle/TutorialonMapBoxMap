# mapbox_demo

## Getting Started

This project is made to teach how to use the MapBox Map package for Flutter apps.

To run the app, make sure you have your Access tokens injected into the app. 
You can find the tokens in the MapBox account.
If you don't already have an account, create one [here](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/)
